# My main concerns:

-	*Accessibility & Portability* – ease of use of the website and minimal latency for each user
-	*Well-developed service* – do less things but do them well
-	*No account approach* – have standalone software with no need for accounts and minimal data collecting from the user
-	*Scalability* – the documentation and architecture should consider further developments of the project and make them easy to implement

# Functional and non-functional requirements:

## Functional:

1.	Record function (start and end a recording).
2.	Playback function and the most important related functions to controlling playback:
2.1.	Playback cursor
*2.1.1.	Moving the playback cursor with a click
2.3.	Start
2.4.	Pause
2.5.	Stop and skip to front
3.	Audio recording display in the playback pane.
4.	Timeline in which the playback and audio tracks are displayed.
5.	Making audio snippet selections with a click and drag.
*6.	Ability to add more than one tracks:
*6.1.	Track mute
*6.2.	Track solo
*6.3.	Control track sound level
7.	Copy and Paste functions.
8.	Exporting recorded audio into a downloadable file.

## Non-functional:

1.	Recording, editing, and exporting is done on MP3 files.
*2.	Recording, editing, and exporting can be done in at least one lossless format such as .wav.
3.	Playback is not disrupted by copy and paste or snippet selection.

*Requirements listed with * are additional things also part of the MVP, but build on existing functionality, therefore should be developed in secondary importance.
